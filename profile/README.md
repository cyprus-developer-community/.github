The Cyprus Developer Community is an initiative to bring together developers,
entrepreneurs, designers, and tech enthusiasts in Cyprus. We aim to create a
base where people can learn, share, and grow together. Each member group is
autonomous and can organize their own events, but we also have a shared calendar
where we can all see what's going on.

We primarily use Discord for casual conversation and this GitHub space to plan
events, talks, and workshops. Everything is free, transparent, open, and
accessible to anyone.
